A detour to the right (positive x-direction) is initiated with a velocity vector angled 30Â° from the vertical. This balances upward progress with lateral movement to avoid collision at the goal. Current velocities of all agents are zero, and nearest human/robot distances (1.21m and 2.0m) are safe. The chosen path avoids conflicts with horizontally moving robots on the left and minimizes interference with other agents.'}

To avoid future collision risks when both start moving (Robot 4's goal is diametrically opposite), a detour is initiated. The recommended velocity (0.5, 0.866) creates a 30-degree rightward deviation while maintaining preferred speed (1.0 m/s). This balances progress toward the goal with lateral separation from Robot 4's expected southbound path. All other agents are stationary and pose no immediate collision risk (nearest human 3.2m away, nearest robot 2.0m away)."}
